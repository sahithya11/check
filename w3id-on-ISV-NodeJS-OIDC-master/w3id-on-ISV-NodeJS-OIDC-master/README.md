node.js sample code

This sample code uses passport-ci-oidc node.js package directly to utilize the discovery endpoint that w3id provides.

First you need to register client application from IBM SSO Provisioner, then update the settings.js with your own client_id, client_secret and callback_url

Then run npm install to download the dependencies.
